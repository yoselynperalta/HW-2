# HW-2
For this weeks challenge we were required to create a web application with no starter code provided. The web page would be our very first portfolio page. 

In the portfolio we need to show our individual skills to present to our future employers. We will list any relevant experiences and project. 

<!-- Acceptance Criteria -->

When I open the portfolio a photo or avatar loads, name, and links to sections About Me, Projects, and Contact Information
When a link in navagation is clicked the UI directs them to the section in the page
When you resize the page or view in various screens the page adjusts accordingly
